### Summary

This is my neovim(>=v0.10) configs and structure that will be change.
For working no problem, you need to add suitable fonts to the terminal that support icons like `JetBrain mono nerd font`.
of course need to install some packages:
- gcc, make, cmake, ripgrep, nodejs, visual-cpp-build-tools(for windows).
